url syntax:
[protocol-name] ://<sub domain>/<domain>/<host>:<port>/<resource-url>
http://test.seeksolution.in:80/web-app/login
http://test.seeksolution.in:/web-app/login

test:sub domain
.in host
:443 port
web-app/login  --resource-url//uri segment
end point

http://facebook.com:80/

https://facebook.com:443/

uri segment: each part seperated by / single slash, is called as uri-segement.
after port : it is basically path to resource
after protocol and before endpoint is called as Domain name.
Every Domain name may have a sub-domain or not but will have a port,
and every domain will have an IP address, since one can not learn or remember the IP address
so, we provide a alias name ,this alias name is called as domain name and this domain name 
has to be registered(mapped) with the  IP and using DNS(domain name server)
