	2. Using laragon web interface
We have only two types of program in a programming language:
1. with input: addition of two number with input
2. without input: hello world

How to create our first input program in web-interface
*****************************************************
Input fields: HTML form
	1.Create a Html form
	2.Add any number of field you require
	3.Add a submit button
	4.Add form tag,with action and method="GET" or method="POST"
	5.Add the server-side page url which is going to handle the request at server-side.
	6.Fill the form and hit on submit button
	7.you will get a Not Found 404 error, because resource does not exist.
	8.Create a server-side page,which can handle client request and 
	process data and give the response.
	9.Use the superGlobal variable of php to accept the request using
	$_REQUEST to handle the form fields.
	10.Since $_REQUEST is a Array,it has a key as name field attribute in Html form
	and use echo statement to display the output and after words comment it.
	11.Note that add id and name attribute on html forms to handle each form controls 
	on server side.
	Concept:This concept is valid for all language jsp,python,asp.net and php also
	id----> for javascript or client side
	name---> for server side
