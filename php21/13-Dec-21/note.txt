Using client side validation in PHP
***********************************
What is validation and types of validation?
1. validating or restricting the user from entering the invalid data in the form field is called
as validation.

Most comfuesing question:
What is difference b/w validation,authentication, authorisation?

	1.validation: it will prevent server from providing invalid or uploading illegal files format in the 
	database or server by the user.
	eg.:Enter the name: 637388229 invalid process validation
	uplaod pic :upload Bahubali.mp4 2gb only 20kb file allowed---invalid file----validation
	Incase of validation there in no involvement of database
	validation:javascript: client side
	validation:Php: server side
	Both side validation should be done because there may be a chance that user may have blocked his
	javascript or disabled the javascript.
	
	Q1:Making an emailId unique for each Registration is example?
	ans: authentication ,because user email will be checked from database.
	Note: Incase of validation either from client side or server side only logic be involed not database.
	
	But checking the format of email is validation.
	neeloo@gmail.com---->format match---->pattern---->pattern matching or regular exepression.
	
	
	2.Authentication:
		Cross checking the identity of existing user from database is called as authentication.
		Such type of feature is used in case of Login,email Verification,Unique email,forget password,
		google login,fb login, github login, linkedIn login...
		OTP verification,OTP login.
		Q:captcha is a which type of validation?
			(completely automated public turing test to tell computers and human apart)
			It is always server side because it involve session storage which is processed at 
			server side only--->session data that is already encrypted.
	
	3.Authorisation:
		It refers to permission given to authenticated user.Once the user is valid then it may 
		have few permission or not have any permission, this concept is authorization.
		
		ex:
		I can register in Panel--->login in there(authenticated)---->loginned---->I can not see any 
		course (authorised for any course). 
		
		eg.:trial user(non-authorased),premieum user(authorised)
			
			Types of authorisation:
			1. no authorisation(user--->role)
			2.Fully authorisation (super admin--->role)
			3.Partially authorisation (admin--->role)
			Roles & permission is kind of authorisation
			
			eg:school erp(enterprise resource planning)
			1. teacher
				|add attendance
				|view attendance
			2. student
				|view attendance
			here student can not add attendance because student is not authorised for,
			adding attendance.
