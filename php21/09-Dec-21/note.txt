MIME : multipurpose internet mail extensions

How browser handle a file loaded in browser?
1. browser checks for the mime type supported by browser meta catalog(dictionary)
2. If it exists,then it will be loaded in the memory. Else it will be thrown as a download
(this is the reason why browser does not give memory allocation to the non-supported file 
and will be send to download.)
This happens because, the browser can support two types of file--
1.Renderable(presentation):
2.Non-renderable()
 
index.html   renderable
p1.txt		 non-renderable
style.css	non-renderable
script.js	non-renderable
p1.png 		renderable
inde.exe		DOWNLOAD(mime type not supported)
p1.jpg		renderable
p1.doc			DOWNLOAD(mime type not supported)
p1.docx			DOWNLOAD(mime type not supported)
p1.xls			DOWNLOAD(mime type not supported)
p1.php		non-renderable

1. mime type supported --> load in memory
a. renderable: the file which follow SGML standard or WHATWG standard.
SGML: support HTML4
WHATWG: support HTML5
file:///C:/Users/NEELOO/Desktop/APP2021/php/08-Dec-21/index.html

b. non-renderable: the file which does not follow SGML standard or WHATWG standard will be loaded
as plain text(as raw file).

file:///C:/Users/NEELOO/Desktop/APP2021/php/08-Dec-21/index.php

 In that case we need to add Handlers to handle such type of file.
HOW to run any PHP file in the browser?
1. Add handler php8---->software>php interpreter-->activate--->plain text-->input parse or compile
or decode-->outside>view port

c:/window/system32/drivers/etc/host
file:///C:/laragon/www/p1.php
http://localhost:786/p1.php

2. mime type not supported--->download, not loaded in memory
